RAPR

Version 1.0.1
=============
1. New rapr-scripts directory supercedes samples apps.

2. New python plotting tools in rapr-tracker directory. (Beta)

3. Now requires latest mgen coming as a release soon, currently
only available in nightly builds. (02/13/14)

4. Numerous bug fixes to work with the latest MGEN

5. Rapr bug fixes.  

6. Changes to initial_seed processing.

If hostID is set use that as the initial seed, if initial_seed is set use that, first one wins.

Previously were defaulting to using the hostID as the initial seed only if
initial seed had not been set - but this was after the script had been
parsed.  If the HOSTID is not passed by event or set in the file this
problem will persist.

7. STLPorts no longer required.

8. Moved to sprng 4.4
